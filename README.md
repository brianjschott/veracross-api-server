# Veracross API Project

## Planning

### Authentication

[Use the passportjs website](http://www.passportjs.org/docs/google/) to authenticate with Google.

1. In Swift app, user must login to Google
2. Whatever token is created is sent to the Express API
3. Then my express app checks to see if it's a valid login token and if it is from the CGPS org
4. Then my API will send the request

### Node JS Server
